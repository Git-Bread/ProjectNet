## .NET Project
Full projekt with all the source code and machine learning modell information. All the source code is present with a prebuilt example that includes config files.

## IMPORTANT!
This project requires the files in "Essentials" to be in a folder named "Config" in the finished build, the program will prompt if something is wrong and will not run untill they exist.
It will not work as intended without these files. Theres also the folder named Extras with projectrapport and the learningdata for the machine learning.
